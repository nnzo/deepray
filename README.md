# DeepRay

Scans for deepslate blocks in the incorrect orientation for anarchy servers.

Go to releases, download the jar and add to your mods folder. Works with 1.21.5

Sometimes it doesn't scan on new chunks/changing servers (please pr if you can fix) so I recommend binding it to "R" or similar and toggling it on and off when searching.
